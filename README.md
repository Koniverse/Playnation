Playnation, founded by visionaries from SubWallet and Wallacy Wallet, is a premier gaming multichain wallet platform integrated into Telegram that allows users to to interact with and play Web3 games within the social messaging platform. 2 months after launch, Playnation has acquired 140K users with 2.6M games played. Our clients so far are Polkadot-SDK-based projects, including 1 project that has finished running their campaign and 3 projects scheduled in our campaign pipeline until August.

## Substrate support and expansion

Built on the core of SubWallet, the most comprehensive Polkadot and Substrate wallet, Playnation can quickly onboard all Substrate-based projects including both parachains and solochains alike. Integrated networks so far include Polkadot, Kusama and Karura. With casual gameplays, hybrid Web3 schemes, and the mission center, Playnation assists Polkadot and Substrate projects throughout the entire marketing cycle from brand awareness to project on-chain growth. 

Moreover, with full EVM compatibility and multichain support for burgeoning ecosystems such as TON and Bitcoin inherited from SubWallet, Playnation aspires to expose and convert these ecosystemsâ€™ users to Polkadot and Substrate projects.

This way, Playnation exposes Substrate projects to not only a massive 900M user base on Telegram but also user bases from other ecosystems.
